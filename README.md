# rayshader_exploration

This repository is used to **exploring `rayshader`**, an R package for **3D terrain visualization**. The examples provided focus on visualizing **South Cascade Glacier in Washington (WA)** using Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and advanced ray tracing techniques.

## About
The goal of this project is to:
- Demonstrate how `rayshader` can be used to **create 3D renderings** of real-world terrain.
- Showcase **glacier retreat visualization** using South Cascade Glacier as a case study.
- Provide **reproducible R scripts** for generating shaded relief maps, animations, and high-quality rendered images.

## Features
- **3D terrain modeling** using `rayshader`
- **Shaded relief & ray-traced lighting effects**
- **Integration with `terra` for raster data processing**
- **Glacier visualization from DEM data**

## Data
The example dataset (`example_data.zip`) contains **spatial data** used in this project, including a DEM of South Cascade Glacier. Users can download and extract it to follow along with the provided R scripts.

## Getting Started
To use this project, clone the repository and run the R scripts inside an R environment.
